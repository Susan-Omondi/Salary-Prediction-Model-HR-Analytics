# Salary-Prediction-Model-HR-Analytics
This project builds a Machine Learning model to help an HR department predict candidate salaries.

This is based on;
- Years of Experience
- Written Test Score (out of 10)
- Interview Score (out of 10)
The goal is to use historical hiring data to predict salaries for future candidates using Multiple Linear Regression.

Data Cleaning Performed:
- Converted experience from words (e.g., "five", "ten") to numeric values
- Filled missing test score values using median
- Removed unnecessary whitespace in column names

 Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

 Machine Learning Model
- Linear Regression.
